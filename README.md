# gitclone-cli

*Work in progress(Currently I'm trying to make this way more performant and allows user to git clone not a user's repositry but org's repos)
This CLI allows you to git clone all the public repos of a certain github user.


# Installation 

```
go get github.com/kazuki1126/gitclone-cli/cmd/gitrepo
```

# Usage

```
Type gitrepo [username] on your terminal.
```
